======

Karel starter code and resources for the Lab09 assignment.

Your finished project should look similar to this sample solution. http://youtu.be/Ogb79h6vwS0

Instructions:
* Use the FORK button to create a copy of this code under your personal Github account
* Clone that copy from your personal Github account onto your computer
* Ask yourself the five questions in the reading, page One-31.
* Read the specification at the bottom of One-31.  Create the class Lab09.java and THREE MAPS of your own design, 'pile1', 'pile2', and 'pile3'.
* If not already done, ADD pile1, pile2 and pile3 maps to your repository so they will be tracked by git.
* Once you have completed the assignment, commit your changes to your computer
* Push the code from your local computer up to your personal Github account
* Initiate a "Pull Request" from your completed project.  This will let me know that you are ready for me to evaluate your work.
